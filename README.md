### üìù Brief Note

**Layout Approach:**
The product card layout uses a custom flexbox grid for responsive design, ensuring 3 cards per row on desktop, 2 on tablet, and 1 on mobile. The card UI is clean and modern, with Material UI icons, color selection, and a prominent Add to Cart button. Product image, title, and price are clickable and navigate to the product detail page.

**Responsiveness Considerations:**
Responsiveness is handled via CSS media queries and a custom grid system, so the product cards adapt gracefully to all screen sizes. All interactive elements remain accessible and visually consistent on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
